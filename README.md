Visualization Toolkit (VTK) Textbook Examples
---------------------------------------------

These examples and data are supplied to support the VTK Textbook (The
Visualization Toolkit, An Object-Oriented Approach To 3D Graphics, 3rd
edition ISBN 1-930934-07-6 printed by Kitware and available at the
Kitware e-store http://www.kitware.com/products/vtktextbook.html).

This distribution is separate from the standard VTK release and CVS
repository because of its size or because the examples duplicate
functionality already found in the VTK/Examples or Testing directories. Feel
free to use this distribution under the conditions of the VTK Copyright shown
below.

This code is not well tested so you may have to adjust it for your VTK
installation. The code has been converted to the VTK4.2 release.  Report any
errors to Will Schroeder (will.schroeder@kitware.com).
